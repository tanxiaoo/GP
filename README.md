# Geospatial Processing Course Project Repository

This repository contains the project for the **Geospatial Processing** course held in 2024 at Polimi.

The project objective is to design and implement a Python-based library for geospatial data analysis and processing. The library will include functionalities for working with vector, raster, or datacube data types, enabling specific geospatial tasks. This repository includes the code, documentation, and testing materials needed to publish a complete and functional geospatial library on GitHub.
